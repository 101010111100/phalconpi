{"name":"Phalcon PI","tagline":"Phalcon PHP Framework C-to-PHP port","body":"# Phalcon PI\r\n\r\nPhalcon PHP is a web framework delivered as a C extension providing high performance and lower resource consumption.\r\n\r\nPhalcon PI (Phalcon PHP Framework PHP Initiative) is a Phalcon PHP Framework C-to-PHP port.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nPhalcon PI is started, because it is possible, it is interesting and it gives a deeper understanding of the framework from the inside. Also it will allow us find those mistakes and non-optimal solutions in the code of the original framework and fix them and make Phalcon PHP Framework even better and faster.\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\nPhalcon PHP Framework is an interesting project to use on a daily basis. However not all of the clients want or are able to have their own VPS/VDS or even Dedicated Server for their 10-50 paged websites.\r\n\r\nPhalcon PI will allow usage of the single framework in highload projects with Dedicated Servers as a PHP extension and for small websites with a simple CMS written with the use of Phalcon PHP Framework with the use of Phalcon PI instead of the PHP extension.\r\n\r\n## Current Version\r\nCurrent version of Phalcon PI is an analogue of the Phalcon PHP Framework version 1.0.1.\r\n\r\n## Components & Status\r\n* [x] Acl (@suxxes)\r\n* [ ] Annotations (@suxxes)\r\n* [ ] Cache\r\n* [ ] CLI\r\n* [ ] Config\r\n* [ ] Db\r\n* [x] DI (@suxxes)\r\n* [ ] Escaper\r\n* [ ] Events\r\n* [ ] Filter\r\n* [ ] Flash\r\n* [ ] Forms\r\n* [ ] Http\r\n* [ ] Loader\r\n* [ ] Logger\r\n* [ ] Mvc\r\n* [ ] Paginator\r\n* [ ] Queue\r\n* [ ] Security\r\n* [ ] Session\r\n* [ ] Tag\r\n* [ ] Translate\r\n* [ ] Validation\r\n\r\n## External Links\r\n\r\n### Phalcon PI\r\n* [Website](http://phalconpi.com/)\r\n* [Twitter](http://docs.phalconphp.com/)\r\n\r\n### Phalcon PHP Framework\r\n* [Website](http://phalconphp.com/)\r\n* [Documentation](http://docs.phalconphp.com/)\r\n* [Support](http://phalconphp.com/support)\r\n* [Blog](http://blog.phalconphp.com)\r\n* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/phalconphp)\r\n\r\n## License Information\r\nPhalcon PHP Framework is open-sourced software licensed under the New BSD License. See the [docs/LICENSE.md](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/blob/master/docs/LICENSE.md) file for more information.\r\n\r\nThis is still in thoughts and will be in talks with the original Phalcon PHP Framework team, because all the code of the framework belongs to its authors, even though Phalcon PI is a completely different approach with modifications and written in a different programming language, but possibly the Phalcon PI will be licensed under the same New BSD License.
