# Phalcon PI

Phalcon is a web framework delivered as a C extension for PHP providing high performance and lower resource consumption.

Phalcon PI (Phalcon Framework PHP Initiative) is a Phalcon Framework C-to-PHP port.

## Why?

Phalcon PI is started, because it is possible, it is interesting and it gives a deeper understanding of the framework from the inside. Also it will allow us find those mistakes and non-optimal solutions in the code of the original framework and fix them and make Phalcon Framework even better and faster.

## Goals

Phalcon Framework is an interesting project to use on a daily basis. However not all of the clients want or are able to have their own VPS/VDS or even Dedicated Server for their 10-50 paged websites.

Phalcon PI will allow usage of the single framework in highload projects with Dedicated Servers as a PHP extension and for small websites with a simple CMS written with the use of Phalcon Framework with the use of Phalcon PI instead of the PHP extension.

## Current Version
Current version of Phalcon PI is an analogue of the Phalcon Framework version 1.0.1.
